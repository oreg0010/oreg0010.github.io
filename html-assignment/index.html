            <h3>Michael Jordan quote</h3>
            <p> 
                "I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. 
                I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, i've been trusted to
                take the game winning shot and missed. i've failed over and over
                and over again in life. And and that is why i succeed." <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/michael_jordan_127660" target="_blank">
